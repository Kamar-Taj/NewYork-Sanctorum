All ABOUT PROCESS
-----------------
Process - "Process" is an executing instance of a program. These are frequently refered as "Tasks".

Types of process
Foreground process: These process are intractive process that which are started by users. These are not automatically started as a part of system functions/services.
Backgorund process: Thesse process are called, non interactive or automatic process. These process are not connected to any terminal or doesn't expect any user input.

Demon - These are special types of background processes that start at system startup and keep running forever as a service; they don’t die. 
They are started as system tasks (run as services). However, they can be controlled by a user via the init process.

Creation of process:
There are two ways to create a process.
1. system() - This method is relatively simple, however, it’s inefficient and has significantly certain security risks.
2. fork() or exec() - This technique is a little advanced but offers greater flexibility, speed, together with security.
The newly created process is called "Child process". The parent process will create the exact copy of itself in memory for child process.
Because of this, the child process will have same environment as it parent. At the time of child creaton, 
the only difference present between parent and child is "PID" or "Process identification number".

How Linux identify process:
In Linux, different users can run different programs. So, to identfy the correct process, Linux assign a unique identification to each
instance. Which is called as "Process identification number" or "PID".
So, to identify a program/instance, Linux useses the PID and PPID (Parent PID). Because of this, we can categorized process into
Parent process - these are processes that create other processes during run-time. 
Child process - these processes are created by other processes during run-time.
