ABOUT KPROBE
-------------
First, we must pay homage to the best-known kernel-debugging technique/tool, the printk. 
It is a universal tool, customisable enough to provide you the desired output — and usually when all else fails, this can save the day! 
It’s very easy to use; it simply prints whatever you like, to track the execution of a module by printing its status after each step, 
and thus pin-pointing bugs and defects.

 In order to implement printk, you need to recompile the kernel with printk statements added to the specific module you’re debugging. 
 This is usually a time-consuming process of building, installing and rebooting the kernel.
