ftrace allows you to perform tracing even for a specific process. In the /sys/kernel/debug/tracing directory, 
the file set_ftrace_pid needs to be updated with the PID of the process you want to be traced. 
The traceprocess.sh sample script below shows how to capture the PID on-the-go, and enable tracing.

1. Check for root permission
2. Check for args to this function
3. Check for debugfs mount

If the above conditions are satisfied. Then start tracing.
4. Flush the existing tracing data
5. Set required tracer function
6. Enable the current tracer
7. write current process id to set_ftrace_pid file
8. Start tracing
9. Execute the process

You can refine it with your own innovations. Run it with the command whose process you want to trace as the argument.
Once tracing is complete, you need to clear the set_ftrace_pid file, for which you can use the following command:
:> set_ftrace_pid

[root@Kamar-Taj]# > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_pid
[root@Kamar-Taj]#cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_pid
no pid
[root@Kamar-Taj]#
