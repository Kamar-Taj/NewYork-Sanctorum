Debugfs needs to be set up to run on the machine you want to use ftrace on. If you are unaware of how to set up debugfs, 
"Debugfs" section, under "Debugging" folder.

debugfs should have been mounted on /sys/kernel/debugfs, and if tracing is enabled, you should be able to see a directory called tracing 
under debugfs. If debugfs is not mounted, you can issue the following command:

# mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug
If you are unable to see the tracing subdirectory, you will need to enable tracing in the kernel configuration, and recompile it. 
Look for the following options to be enabled in the kernel configuration path (refer to Figure 1):
Kernel Hacking -> Tracers

Kernel Function Tracer (FUNCTION_TRACER)
Kernel Function Graph Tracer (FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER)
Enable/disable ftrace dynamically (DYNAMIC_FTRACE)
Trace max stack (STACK_TRACER)

Depending on your architecture, a few more tracers can be enabled during compilation, as per requirements. 
The listed tracers are for debugging. Once the kernel compilation is complete, and you have booted to the new kernel, 
tracing can be initiated.
